## ML/Systems Contract Gaps

Systematic gap analysis against the full ML systems landscape.
Current registry: 271 scored contracts (896 equations). 9 domains analyzed.
Updated 2026-04-03 with infrastructure contracts (MCP, CLI, HTTP).

### 1. Training Infrastructure (major gap)

AdamW and L-BFGS exist but almost nothing else from the optimizer ecosystem.

**Missing:**
- Adam variants (Adadelta, Lion, Muon)
- Learning rate schedulers (cosine with warmup, one-cycle)
- Gradient clipping (global norm vs per-param)
- Gradient accumulation correctness
- **Distributed training allreduce** (ring-allreduce, NCCL semantics)

### 2. Quantization (partial gap)

Q4K/Q6K superblocks and quantization ordering exist.

**Missing:**
- **GPTQ** (block-wise second-order quantization)
- **AWQ** (activation-aware weight quantization)
- **INT8 GEMM** semantics
- **FP8 (e4m3/e5m2 interchange)** — small state space, tractable for Kani
- **QLoRA dequantization** kernels

### 3. Attention Variants (partially covered)

Flash attention and sliding window exist.

**Missing:**
- **Flash-Decoding v2** (split-KV parallelization)
- **Ring Attention** (sequence parallelism across GPUs)
- **MLA** (DeepSeek multi-head latent attention with KV compression)

### 4. Memory Management (biggest practical gap)

KV cache sizing and equivalence exist.

**Missing:**
- **PagedAttention** (vLLM block-table semantics) — pointer aliasing, Kani-tractable
- **Prefix caching** invariants
- **Speculative decoding** correctness (draft/verify loop) — highest Kani leverage

### 5. Numerical Precision (mostly missing)

F16 conversion exists.

**Missing:**
- **BF16 rounding behavior**
- **FP8 scaled tensor semantics** — directly needed for trueno
- **Stochastic rounding** contracts

### 6. Tokenization / Data Pipeline (entirely absent)

Zero contracts. Major class of silent correctness failure.

**Missing:**
- **BPE merge correctness** — associativity and round-trip provable
- Sequence packing (multi-document attention mask algebra)
- Data collation invariants

### 7. SIMD / Hardware Abstraction (partial)

Roofline and kernel launch budget exist.

**Missing:**
- **Warp divergence bounds**
- **Memory coalescing contracts**
- **WGPU/Metal** compute semantics

### 8. Post-Training / Alignment (almost entirely absent)

LoRA algebra exists.

**Missing:**
- **DPO/RLHF loss** correctness (log-ratio clipping, KL terms) — single equation, high value
- **PPO/GRPO** policy update invariants
- **Reward model** contracts

### 9. Inference Serving (mostly missing)

Sampling algorithms exist.

**Missing:**
- **Continuous batching** correctness (iteration-level scheduling)
- **Tensor parallelism** (column/row linear split contracts)
- **CUDA graph capture** constraints

## Shape Contract Gaps

The repo has 7 shape-aware contracts (tensor-shape-flow, validated-tensor,
qwen35-shapes, kv-cache-sizing, model-config-algebra, format-parity,
tensor-inventory). Analysis of what's missing:

### Shape Algebra is Point-in-Time, Not Compositional

Existing contracts verify individual tensor shapes or model-specific
consistency. Missing: a *compositional* shape type system — proofs that
shapes propagate correctly through arbitrary operator sequences.

### Broadcast Semantics Uncontracted

NumPy/PyTorch broadcast rules (right-align, size-1-expand) have known
edge cases. No contract captures when broadcast is valid, when it
silently produces wrong shapes, or rank promotion rules.

### Batch Dimension Contracts Absent

The difference between `[B, S, H]` and `[S, B, H]` is invisible to most
shape checks but silently produces wrong results. No contracts around
batch dimension position invariants.

### Dynamic Shape Reasoning Missing

Contracts for shapes depending on runtime values — sequence length after
padding removal, variable-length batches, dynamic KV cache slicing.
Hardest shape bugs in practice.

### Contiguity and Stride Contracts Absent

A tensor can have correct logical shape but wrong physical layout
(non-contiguous after transpose). No contracts for when a kernel requires
contiguous input, what `.contiguous()` guarantees, or stride-based view
correctness. Directly relevant to trueno SIMD alignment assumptions.

### Operator-Level Shape Inference Missing

Each operator (conv, matmul, gather, scatter, einsum) has a shape
inference rule from its math. The repo has matmul/conv1d kernel contracts
but not their *shape inference* contracts.

### Einsum Contraction Correctness Absent

Index contraction rules (what gets summed, what survives, dimension
compatibility) are provable properties with no contract.

## Highest-Leverage Additions (ranked by impact x Kani tractability)

| Priority | Contract | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Speculative decoding** | Tractable BMC, clear acceptance criterion, not yet formally verified |
| 2 | **FP8 e4m3/e5m2 interchange** | Small state space, directly needed for trueno |
| 3 | **DPO loss** | Single log-ratio clipping equation with known failure modes |
| 4 | **BPE tokenization** | Merge rule associativity and round-trip are provable |
| 5 | **PagedAttention block table** | Pointer aliasing invariants — exactly what Kani excels at |
| 6 | **Shape type algebra** | Formalizes dependent-type shape safety for Kani verification |
| 7 | **Broadcast semantics** | Small rule set, tractable, prevents silent shape bugs |
| 8 | **Operator shape inference** | 6 core transforms (reshape, permute, broadcast, slice, gather, scatter) |
| 9 | **Allreduce correctness** | Ring-allreduce associativity/commutativity provable |
| 10 | **Continuous batching** | Scheduling invariants for inference serving |
