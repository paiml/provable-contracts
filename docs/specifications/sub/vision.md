# 1. Vision and Architecture

**Papers to Math to Contracts in Code.**

## The Problem

ML kernel implementations derive from research papers, but the derivation
chain is invisible:

```
Paper (LaTeX) -> Developer's head -> Code -> Tests -> Ship
```

The developer's head is an unauditable black box. When a SIMD kernel
produces wrong results six months later, nobody can trace back to which
equation was violated or which paper assumption broke.

## The Solution

Make the derivation chain explicit, auditable, and provable:

```
Paper (arXiv)
  -> Equations (canonical math)
    -> Contract (YAML, machine-parseable)
      -> Trait (Rust scaffold)
        -> Kernel (scalar, SIMD, PTX)
          -> Tests (probar property tests)
            -> Proof (Kani bounded model checking)
              -> Theorem (Lean 4 unbounded proof)
```

Every link is a concrete artifact in version control. The final links —
Kani and Lean 4 — elevate this from "really good testing" to "actual
proof."

## Theoretical Foundations

| Foundation | Source | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Falsificationism | Popper (1959) | Tests designed to refute, not confirm |
| Poka-Yoke | Shingo (1986) | `ValidatedTensor` makes bad states unrepresentable |
| Jidoka | Ohno (1988) | Stop the line on first defect |
| Design by Contract | Meyer (1988) | Preconditions, postconditions, invariants |
| Type-Driven Dev | Brady (2017) | Parse, don't validate (King 2019) |
| Equation-Driven Dev | batuta oracle | Equation -> failing test -> impl -> verify |
| Bounded Model Checking | Kani (AWS 2022) | Exhaustive verification within bounds |
| Theorem Proving | Lean 4 + Mathlib | Unbounded proofs over mathematical reals |

> **v2.2.0 Correction (2026-03-28):** Previous versions inflated binding
> counts with mass-generated entries lacking `module_path`. v2.2.0 stripped
> 28,206 ghost bindings, leaving 660 real bindings that reference actual
> module paths. Of those, ~234 resolve to functions in source code.
> The honest binding rate is **234 verified / 516 equations = 45%** for
> the best-covered repo (aprender), not the 100% previously claimed.
>
> **v2.3.0 Correction (2026-03-28):** `pv coverage` recursion bug fixed —
> previously only scanned top-level contracts/ (131 files), now recurses
> into subdirectories (165 parseable contracts). Totals updated accordingly.
>
> **v2.6.0 Update (2026-04-04):** Fleet expanded from 25→40 repos via
> `source_dir` binding.yaml field. Real binding entries grew to 958 (from
> 660) with 6 new apr-cli bindings and 4 new binding stubs. kaizen now
> resolves name-mismatched repos (pmat → paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit,
> pmcp → rust-mcp-sdk). PV-AUD-003 reduced to 0. pmat infrastructure
> contracts at 0 lint warnings (51/51 equations with pre+postconditions).
> Work-DBC lifecycle state machine falsified and fixed in pmat implementation.
