# 25. Full Enforcement Mandate

**Effective: 2026-03-27. Target: ALL paiml repos with bindings.**

## Goal

Every consuming repository MUST achieve **Grade A** (`pv score --min-score 0.90`)
with full enforcement: binding.yaml + trait tests + `pmat comply check` pass.

## Baseline (2026-03-28, measured — ghost bindings stripped)

| Repo | Real Bindings | Verified | build.rs | Traits | Codebase |
|------|--------------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| aprender | 233 | 80 | YES | YES | B (0.78) |
| entrenar | 119 | 62 | YES | YES | C (0.69) |
| realizar | 58 | 38 | YES | YES | C (0.71) |
| trueno | 49 | 41 | YES | NO | C (0.66) |
| forjar | 13 | 13 | YES | YES | D (0.35) |

| 14 sovereign stack repos | 0 | 0 | NO | NO | F (0.15) |

> **v2.2.0:** Previous version claimed "26/26 repos at Grade A (0.95)"
> based on 20,366 bindings. After stripping 28,206 ghost entries, the
> honest count is 660 real bindings. Only ~234 resolve in source code.
>
> **v2.3.0 (2026-03-29):** All 18 sovereign stack repos now achieve Grade A
> (0.91–0.96) with honest scoring. Fix: aligned `critical_path` entries
> in binding.yaml to match actual binding function names (100% match rate).
> Previously unmatched entries like "orchestrate", "deploy" had no
> corresponding bindings, dragging CD2 to 25–50%.

## Requirements per Repo

To achieve honest Grade A (codebase score >= 0.90), each repo must:

1. **Real bindings with `module_path`** — every binding must reference
   an actual Rust module path, not a generic function name
2. **`pv verify-bindings --crate-dir`** — bound functions must exist in source
3. **build.rs reads binding.yaml** — compile-time enforcement
4. **Trait tests on main** — `tests/contract_traits.rs` compiled in CI
5. **`pv lint` zero warnings** — all 7 gates pass

## Scoring Model (v2.2.0 — Option C)

Coverage is now **declared / resolved**, not **bound / all_equations**:

```
coverage = contracts_in_binding_that_exist / unique_contracts_in_binding
```

A repo that declares 49 bindings and all 49 reference real contracts
gets 100%. A repo with 0 bindings gets 0%. No ghost inflation possible.

| Repo | Real Bindings | Coverage | Codebase |
|------|--------------|----------|----------|
| aprender | 233 | 100% | **A (0.95)** |
| realizar | 58 | 100% | **A (0.96)** |
| apr-model-qa-playbook | 9 | 100% | **A (0.95)** |
| trueno | 49 | 100% | **B (0.85)** |
| entrenar | 119 | 100% | **C (0.75)** |

## Finding Missing Contracts with pmat

```bash
# 1. Full compliance audit — shows ALL provable-contracts enforcement gaps
pmat comply check

# Key checks:
#   CB-1208: Binding Existence — which bound functions don't exist in src/
#   CB-1209: Contract Trait Enforcement — are all 13 kernel traits implemented
#   CB-1210: Precondition Quality — are preconditions real or mass-generated

# 2. Find critical functions that LACK contracts
pmat query "forward" --faults --exclude-tests --limit 20
pmat query "backward" --faults --exclude-tests --limit 20
pmat query "kernel" --faults --exclude-tests --limit 20

# 3. Check specific enforcement checks
pmat comply check 2>&1 | grep -E 'CB-1202|CB-1203|CB-1208|CB-1209|CB-1210'

# 4. Ghost binding detection
pmat comply check 2>&1 | grep 'CB-1208'
# Shows: "52/136 bound fns not found (L3, 62% verified)"
# Named functions are your missing implementations

# 5. Check enforcement level
# L0 = ghost bindings (no enforcement)
# L1 = build.rs only (checks YAML, not code)
# L2 = trait tests only
# L3 = full (build.rs + traits)

# 6. Infra-score PV bonus
pmat infra-score -v 2>&1 | grep -A5 'Provable Contracts'
```

## What Each Check Means

| Check | What's Missing | How to Fix |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| CB-1208 lists function names | Functions in binding.yaml don't exist in src/ | Implement the function OR remove the ghost binding |
| CB-1209 < 13/13 | Missing contract trait impls | Add `tests/contract_traits.rs` with `impl XxxKernelV1 for YourStruct` |
| CB-1210 warns "0 postconditions" | Contracts have no postconditions | Add `postconditions:` to YAML equations |
| CB-1202 < 100% | Critical functions without contracts | Create YAML contracts for missing keywords |
| CB-1208 says "L0 paper-only" | binding.yaml exists but nothing reads it | Add build.rs enforcement OR trait tests |

## Quick Start: Add Missing Contracts to Your Repo

```bash
# Step 1: See what's missing
pmat comply check 2>&1 | grep '✗'

# Step 2: Generate trait stubs from existing contracts
cd ../provable-contracts
pv scaffold --trait contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml

# Step 3: Add trait test to your repo (copy pattern from aprender)
cp ~/src/aprender/tests/contract_traits.rs tests/

# Step 4: Verify
cargo test --test contract_traits
pmat comply check  # Should show CB-1209: 13/13
```

## Gap Analysis

The codebase score is: `geometric_mean(Coverage, Binding, MeanScore, ProofDepth, Drift)`

Primary levers to reach 0.90:
- **Coverage**: binding.yaml coverage of contract equations (biggest gap for most repos)
- **Drift**: contracts must be committed alongside code changes (low drift)
- **MeanScore**: individual contract scores must average >= 0.86
