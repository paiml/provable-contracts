# Phase 7: Theorem Proving — Lean 4 Integration

## RFC: Unbounded Verification via Lean 4 Proof Discharge

**Repository:** `paiml/provable-contracts`
**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** Noah Gift
**Priority:** P1 — Strategic
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `verification`, `lean4`, `phase-7`

---

## Summary

Extend the six-phase provable-contracts pipeline with a seventh phase:
**full theorem proving via Lean 4**. This phase completes the
verification hierarchy by discharging proof obligations as
machine-checked theorems with no bounds on input size, data type, or
vector dimension — achieving what Kani bounded model checking cannot.

The current pipeline terminates at Phase 6 (Kani BMC), which proves
correctness within finite bounds. Phase 7 lifts selected obligations
into Lean 4's dependent type theory, producing proofs valid
**for all inputs unconditionally**.

```
Phase 5: Falsify   →  Probabilistic confidence  (proptest/probar)
Phase 6: Verify    →  Bounded certainty         (Kani BMC)
Phase 7: Prove     →  Unbounded certainty       (Lean 4)
```

---

## Motivation

### The Bounded Verification Gap

Kani proves `softmax_non_negative` for all `f32` vectors up to length `N=8`. But:

- What about `N=65536` (a real transformer sequence length)?
- What about the algebraic identity `Σᵢ softmax(xᵢ) = 1` independent of precision?
- What about compositional properties across the Qwen 3.5 verification DAG?

These require **unbounded proofs over mathematical reals**, which is
precisely what Lean 4 + Mathlib provide.

### The Obligation Coverage Argument

The repo currently tracks **262 proof obligations** across 48
contracts. Each has at least one falsification test. Many have Kani
harnesses. But the verification level for each obligation is implicit.
Phase 7 makes the **proof hierarchy explicit and auditable** per
obligation.

### Strategic Differentiation

No existing project offers a traceable pipeline from peer-reviewed
paper → YAML contract → Rust implementation → property tests →
bounded model checking → machine-checked theorem. This positions
provable-contracts uniquely in both the formal methods and ML systems
communities.

## Design

### 7.1 Verification Hierarchy Model

Each proof obligation gains a `verification_level` field representing
the highest level at which it has been discharged:

| Level | Method | Guarantees | Tool |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| L0 | Untested | None | — |
| L1 | Unit tests | Spot checks | `cargo test` |
| L2 | Property tests | Probabilistic falsification | probar / proptest |
| L3 | Bounded model checking | Exhaustive within bounds | Kani |
| L4 | Theorem proving | Unbounded, unconditional | Lean 4 |

Obligations can be discharged at multiple levels simultaneously.
Higher levels subsume lower ones logically but serve different
practical purposes (L2 catches regressions fast; L4 provides
mathematical certainty).

### 7.2 YAML Contract Schema Extensions

```yaml
# Existing fields preserved; new fields added per obligation
proof_obligations:
  - id: softmax-partition-unity
    statement: "∀ x ∈ ℝⁿ, Σᵢ softmax(xᵢ) = 1"
    tier: universal-algebraic
    
    # Existing Phase 5-6 fields
    falsification: softmax_partition_sum_ne_one
    kani_harness: softmax_partition_unity_bmc
    kani_bound: 8
    
    # New Phase 7 fields
    lean:
      theorem: Softmax.partition_of_unity
      module: ProvableContracts.Softmax
      status: proved          # proved | sorry | wip | not-applicable
      depends_on:             # Lean-level theorem dependencies
        - Real.exp_pos
        - Finset.sum_div_distrib
      mathlib_imports:
        - Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.ExpDeriv
        - Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Group.Finset
      notes: "Proof over reals; f32 gap addressed by error-bound lemma"
```

New top-level contract metadata:

```yaml
verification_summary:
  total_obligations: 12
  l2_property_tested: 12
  l3_kani_proved: 9
  l4_lean_proved: 5
  l4_sorry_count: 3
  l4_not_applicable: 4    # e.g., performance obligations
```

### 7.4 CLI Commands

#### `pv lean <contract.yaml> [--output-dir <dir>]`

Generate Lean 4 source files from a contract. Produces:

- **Definition file** with kernel function as a Lean `def` over `ℝ`

- **Import structure** based on Mathlib dependencies

```bash
$ pv lean contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml --output-dir lean/

Generated:
  lean/ProvableContracts/Defs/Softmax.lean        (3 definitions)
  lean/ProvableContracts/Theorems/Softmax/
    PartitionOfUnity.lean    (sorry)

  Lean Theorem:   Softmax.shift_invariance              ⚠ SORRY
  Chain:          PARTIAL (L3, L4 pending)
```

#### `pv lean-sync <contract.yaml> <lean-dir/>`

Verify that Lean definitions and theorem names match the YAML
contract. Catches drift between the contract specification and the
Lean formalization.

```bash
$ pv lean-sync contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml lean/

✓ Definition Softmax.softmax matches equation eq-softmax-def
✓ Theorem Softmax.partition_of_unity matches obligation softmax-partition-unity
✗ Missing theorem for obligation softmax-temperature-scaling
✗ Lean theorem Softmax.exp_sum_pos has no matching obligation
```

### 7.5 Obligation Triage: What Gets a Lean Proof

Not every obligation warrants a Lean proof. The triage criteria:

| Category | Lean Priority | Rationale |
|----------|:---:|-----------|
| Universal algebraic identities | **High** | `Σ softmax = 1`, RMSNorm idempotence. Lean proves these cleanly over reals. |
| Compositional correctness | **High** | Qwen 3.5 verification DAG. Lean's module system maps to contract dependencies. |
| Monotonicity / ordering | **High** | `x > y → softmax(x) > softmax(y)`. Natural in Lean's `Mathlib.Order`. |
| Numerical error bounds | **Medium** | Real→f32 gap quantification. Requires careful epsilon arithmetic. |
| Equivalence proofs | **Medium** | Flash attention ↔ standard attention. Substantial but high-value. |
| Convergence properties | **Medium** | AdamW, L-BFGS, CMA-ES. Often require analysis beyond current Mathlib. |
| Performance / hardware | **Skip** | Roofline model, kernel launch budget. Empirical by nature. |
| Shape / dimension checks | **Skip** | Already well-served by Rust's type system + Kani. |

### 7.6 Bridging the Real↔Float Gap

Lean proofs operate over `ℝ` (mathematical reals). Rust code
operates over `f32`/`f64`. This gap must be explicitly addressed:

**Strategy: Layered Proofs**

1. **Ideal layer** (Lean): Prove the property over `ℝ` unconditionally
2. **Error layer** (Lean): Prove an error bound: if inputs are
   within `[−M, M]` and operations use IEEE 754 rounding, the f32
   result deviates from the real result by at most `ε`
3. **Concrete layer** (Kani): Verify the Rust implementation matches
   the error-bounded specification for concrete bit-widths

```lean
-- Ideal layer
theorem softmax_partition_of_unity (x : Vector ℝ n) :
    ∑ i, softmax x i = 1 := by ...

-- Error layer
theorem softmax_partition_f32_error (x : Vector Float32 n)
    (hx : ∀ i, |x i| ≤ 88) :  -- f32 exp overflow guard
    |∑ i, softmax_f32 x i - 1| ≤ n * Float32.epsilon := by ...
```

This makes the verification hierarchy not just a progression of
strength, but a **refinement from ideal to concrete**.

### 7.7 Compositional Proofs and the Qwen 3.5 DAG

The Qwen 3.5 end-to-end verification contract composes 8
sub-contracts. In Lean, this becomes a compositional proof where
sub-contract theorems are combined:

```lean
-- Each sub-contract provides its own correctness theorem
import ProvableContracts.Theorems.Softmax.PartitionOfUnity
import ProvableContracts.Theorems.Attention.Scaling
import ProvableContracts.Theorems.Composition.QwenForward

-- The compositional theorem references sub-theorems
theorem qwen35_e2e_correctness
    (config : Qwen35Config)
    (input : Tensor ℝ [config.seq_len, config.hidden_dim])
    (hconfig : config.valid) :
    let output := qwen35_forward config input
    output.logits_valid ∧ output.attention_valid ∧ output.norm_valid := by
  constructor
  · exact attention_scaling_correct config input hconfig
  constructor  
  · exact sliding_window_attention_correct config input hconfig
  · exact rmsnorm_idempotent config input hconfig
```

The contract dependency graph becomes a **theorem dependency graph**
— the exact structure your `pv graph` command already visualizes.

---

## Dependencies

- **Lean 4** (stable release) + **Mathlib** (latest)
- `lake` build system
- Mathlib modules: `Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp`,
  `Algebra.BigOperators`, `Topology.MetricSpace`, `Order.Basic`
- CI: GitHub Actions with `leanprover/lean4-action`

---

## Open Questions

1. **Extraction:** Should Lean proofs extract to executable Rust via
   C FFI, or remain a parallel verification artifact?
   (Recommendation: parallel artifact — extraction adds complexity
   with marginal runtime benefit since Rust implementations already
   exist.)

2. **Automation:** How aggressively to invest in LLM-assisted proof?
   Lean Copilot can discharge simple goals but struggles with
   multi-step algebraic reasoning. Budget time for manual proofs.

3. **Granularity:** Should every equation get a Lean definition, or
   only equations referenced by proof obligations? (Recommendation:
   only obligated equations to avoid maintenance burden.)

4. **Mathlib stability:** Mathlib moves fast and breaks imports. Pin
   a Mathlib version per release cycle and batch-update.
