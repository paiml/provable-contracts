## 1. Motivation

### The Problem

ML kernel implementations are derived from research papers, but the derivation
chain is invisible:

```
Paper (LaTeX) → Developer's head → Code → Tests → Ship
```

The developer's head is an unauditable black box. When a SIMD kernel produces
wrong results six months later, nobody can trace back to which equation was
violated or which paper assumption was broken.

### Evidence from Production

Four contracts already exist in aprender, each born from a production incident:

| Contract | Root Cause | Incident |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `tensor-layout-v1.yaml` | SafeTensors 94.5% zeros passed structural checks | PMAT-234 |
| `layer-parity-v1.yaml` | 7B GPU produced garbage, no way to compare with CPU | PMAT-232 |
| `kernel-fusion-v1.yaml` | Fused kernel existed but was never wired in | PAR-077 |
| `quantized-dot-product-v1.yaml` | SIMD kernels had no reference to compare against | PAR-001 |

Every incident would have been prevented if the mathematical specification had
been the source of truth, not the code.

### The Solution

Make the derivation chain explicit, auditable, and **provable**:

```
Paper (arXiv) → Equations → Contract (YAML) → Trait (Rust) → Kernel (SIMD) → Tests (probar) → Proof (Kani)
       ↑                         ↑                                                ↑                ↑
   peer-reviewed           machine-parseable                                 falsifiable    formally verified
```

Every link in this chain is a concrete artifact in version control.
The final link — Kani bounded model checking — is what elevates this from
"really good testing" to "actual proof."

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Popperian Falsificationism

> "A theory is scientific if and only if it makes falsifiable predictions."
> — Karl Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (1959)

A contract is not a wish list. Every rule must have a **falsification test** — a
concrete experiment that would **disprove** the implementation's correctness if
the implementation is wrong. If a contract rule cannot be falsified, it is not a
contract rule; it is documentation.

**Application:** Every YAML contract entry has:
- `prediction`: what the correct implementation guarantees
- `falsification_test`: code that would PASS if the implementation is WRONG
- `if_fails`: what a failure means (root cause diagnosis)

### 2.2 Toyota Production System (TPS)

**Poka-Yoke** (mistake-proofing): Make it impossible to do wrong.

> "The most effective approach to mistake-proofing is to design the process so
> that mistakes cannot be made."
> — Shigeo Shingo, *Zero Quality Control* (1986)

**Application:** Rust's type system as Poka-Yoke. `ValidatedTensor<T>` types
that can only be constructed through validation. The compiler rejects wrong
states — it's not a runtime check, it's a physical impossibility.

**Jidoka** (automation with a human touch): Stop the line on first defect.

**Application:** Load-time parity gates. If GPU output diverges from CPU
reference, the model constructor returns an error. No garbage reaches inference.

**Genchi Genbutsu** (go and see): Verify by direct observation, not reports.

**Application:** Falsification tests run the actual code with known-bad input.
We don't trust that validation works — we prove it catches bad data.

### 2.3 Type-Driven Development

> "Make illegal states unrepresentable."
> — Edwin Brady, *Type-Driven Development with Idris* (2017)

And the Haskell community's extension:

> "Parse, Don't Validate."
> — Alexis King (2019)

**Application:** Raw `Vec<f32>` is parsed into `ValidatedWeight` (with
invariant checks) at the system boundary. All internal code operates on
validated types. The gap between "data exists" and "data is correct" is closed
by construction.

### 2.4 Equation-Driven Development (EDD)

The batuta oracle's `quality-edd` recipe formalizes this cycle:

```
Equation → Failing Test → Implementation → Verification → Falsification
```

This is TDD with a mathematical preamble. The equation comes first. The test
is derived from the equation's invariants. The implementation must satisfy the
test. The falsification demonstrates conditions under which the implementation
would break (and proves it doesn't).

### 2.5 Design by Contract (DbC)

> "A contract defines the obligations and benefits of each party."
> — Bertrand Meyer, *Object-Oriented Software Construction* (1988)

**Preconditions:** What the caller guarantees (input shapes, finite values).
**Postconditions:** What the kernel guarantees (output shape, numerical bounds).
**Invariants:** What holds throughout (energy conservation, normalization).

### 2.6 Bounded Model Checking (Kani)

> "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not their absence."
> — Edsger Dijkstra

Property-based testing (probar/proptest) checks 10,000 random inputs. That's
Level 2 on the verification ladder. It catches most bugs but cannot guarantee
correctness for ALL inputs. Kani closes this gap.

**Kani** (Amazon, open source) is a bounded model checker for Rust. Instead of
sampling random inputs, it symbolically explores **every possible execution
path** up to a given bound. If Kani says "verified," the property holds for ALL
inputs within that bound — not 10,000 of them, ALL of them.

**How it works:**
1. `kani::any::<T>()` creates a **symbolic value** representing every possible
   bit pattern of type `T`.
2. `kani::assume(predicate)` constrains the symbolic space (preconditions).
3. `assert!(postcondition)` must hold for every surviving path.
4. Kani compiles Rust to CBMC (C Bounded Model Checker) IR and exhaustively
   explores the state space using SAT/SMT solvers (CaDiCaL, kissat, Z3).

**Why Kani for ML kernels:**
- **SIMD intrinsics are fully supported.** All `simd_add`, `simd_mul`,
  `simd_shuffle`, `simd_reduce_*` operations are modeled precisely. This means
  we can prove SIMD kernels match scalar references for ALL inputs, not just
  sampled ones.
- **Integer arithmetic is exact.** Quantized dot products (Q4_K, Q6_K, Q8_0)
  use integer sub-block sums. Kani proves these exactly — no tolerance needed.
- **Function contracts** (`#[kani::requires]`, `#[kani::ensures]`) map directly
  to DbC preconditions/postconditions from Section 2.5.
- **Compositional verification** via `#[kani::stub_verified]` — prove each
  kernel in isolation, then compose proofs for the full transformer layer.

**Limitations (honest):**
- **Float transcendentals are over-approximated.** `exp()`, `sqrt()`, `sin()`
  return nondeterministic values in valid ranges. For softmax (`exp`) and
  RMSNorm (`sqrt`), we must stub these with bounded approximations or verify
  the integer/structural logic separately.
- **Bounded, not unbounded.** Verification holds for vectors up to size N
  (set by `#[kani::unwind]`). We choose N to cover all realistic kernel
  invocation sizes.
- **State space explosion.** Large bounds + many branches = slow. Practical
  limit is ~256 elements for most kernels, which covers one super-block.

**The key insight:** Kani's limitations align perfectly with our kernel
structure. Quantized kernels operate on fixed-size super-blocks (256 elements).
SIMD operates on fixed-width lanes (8×f32 for AVX2, 16×f32 for AVX-512).
These are naturally bounded — Kani can verify them exhaustively.

**Production precedent:**
- AWS Firecracker: 27 Kani harnesses verified VirtIO and rate limiter.
  Found a rounding bug allowing guests to exceed I/O bandwidth by 0.01%.
- AWS s2n-quic: 30+ harnesses across QUIC protocol. Same harness runs as
  fuzz test OR Kani proof via Bolero framework.
- Rust standard library: Ongoing community verification effort using Kani.

## 3. The Verification Ladder

Every proof obligation in a contract is verified at multiple levels. Higher
levels subsume lower ones. The goal is to push every obligation as high as
practically possible.

```
Level   Method                  Tool            What it proves
─────   ──────                  ────            ──────────────
  5     Mathematical proof      Lean/Coq        True for ALL inputs. Period.
                                                (out of scope for this project)

  4     Bounded model check     Kani ←────────  True for ALL inputs up to size N.
        (formal verification)                   Exhaustive. No sampling. ACTUAL PROOF
                                                within the bound.        ← TARGET

  3     Property-based test     probar/proptest  True for ~10,000 random inputs.
        + metamorphic                            High confidence, not proof.

  2     Contract test           #[test]          True for specific edge cases
        (falsification)                          chosen by developer.

  1     Type system             rustc            True by construction.
        (Poka-Yoke)                              Compile error if violated.

  0     Code review             Human eyes       "Looks right to me."
```

### Where Each Tool Lives

| Obligation Type | Level 1 (Types) | Level 3 (probar) | Level 4 (Kani) |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Shape correctness | `ValidatedTensor` newtype | N/A (compile-time) | N/A (compile-time) |
| Softmax sums to 1 | N/A | proptest random vectors | `#[kani::proof]` all vectors ≤ 16 |
| SIMD = scalar | N/A | proptest random data | `#[kani::proof]` all data ≤ 256 |
| No overflow | N/A | proptest edge cases | Kani automatic (checks ALL paths) |
| Quantized bsums correct | N/A | proptest random blocks | `#[kani::proof]` all blocks (integer-exact) |
| Format isolation | `#[test]` cross-format | N/A | `#[kani::proof]` + `#[kani::should_panic]` |

### The Provability Claim

When we say a kernel is "provable," we mean:

1. **Level 1:** The type system prevents invalid construction (Poka-Yoke).
2. **Level 3:** probar has tested the property for 10,000+ random inputs.
3. **Level 4:** Kani has exhaustively verified the property for ALL inputs up
   to the kernel's natural bound (super-block size, SIMD width, etc.).

This is not Level 5 (full mathematical proof in Lean/Coq). But for fixed-size
kernel operations — which is what ML inference IS — bounded verification at
the natural bound IS exhaustive. A Q4_K super-block is always 256 elements.
Verifying for all 256-element inputs IS verifying for all inputs.

## 6. Phase 1: Extract — Paper to Canonical Math

### Input

An arXiv paper (or equivalent peer-reviewed source) containing a mathematical
operation used in ML inference or training.

### Process

1. **Identify the governing equation(s).** These are the equations that define
   what the kernel computes. Not the loss function, not the training procedure —
   the forward pass computation.

2. **Identify the domain and codomain.** What goes in, what comes out, what are
   the shapes and types.

3. **Extract proof obligations.** These are the mathematical properties that
   the implementation MUST satisfy. They come in several flavors (see
   [Section 12](#12-proof-obligation-taxonomy)).

4. **Identify numerical stability requirements.** Papers often describe the
   "textbook" formula and then a "numerically stable" variant. Both must be
   documented. The stable variant is what gets implemented; the textbook
   variant is what gets tested against.

5. **Note assumptions and boundary conditions.** Papers assume infinite
   precision. Code doesn't. Document where precision loss occurs and what
   tolerance is acceptable.

### Output

A `MATH.md` file with:
- Paper citation (arXiv URL, authors, year)
- Governing equations in canonical form
- Proof obligation table
- Numerical stability notes
- Boundary conditions

### Example: Softmax

**Paper:** Implicit in many; canonical treatment in Bridle (1990), Goodfellow
et al. (2016) Ch. 6.2.2.

**Governing equation (textbook):**

```
softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i) / sum_j(exp(x_j))
```

**Governing equation (numerically stable):**

```
softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i - max(x)) / sum_j(exp(x_j - max(x)))
```

**Proof obligations:**

| ID | Type | Property | Formal |
|----|------|----------|--------|
| SM-INV-001 | Invariant | Output sums to 1 | `|sum(softmax(x)) - 1.0| < ε` |
| SM-INV-002 | Invariant | All outputs positive | `softmax(x)_i > 0 ∀i` |
| SM-INV-003 | Invariant | Output in (0,1) | `0 < softmax(x)_i < 1 ∀i` |
| SM-EQV-001 | Equivalence | Shift invariance | `softmax(x) = softmax(x + c) ∀c ∈ ℝ` |
| SM-MON-001 | Monotonicity | Order preservation | `x_i > x_j → softmax(x)_i > softmax(x)_j` |
| SM-BND-001 | Bound | Argmax dominance | `softmax(x)_{argmax} ≥ 1/n` |
| SM-LIN-001 | Non-linearity | Not homogeneous | `softmax(αx) ≠ α·softmax(x)` in general |

**Numerical stability:**
- Textbook formula overflows for `x_i > 88.7` (f32) due to `exp(x_i)`.
- Stable variant subtracts `max(x)` first. Largest exponent is `exp(0) = 1`.
- Underflow: for very negative values, `exp(x_i - max(x)) → 0`. Acceptable —
  these entries are negligible in the softmax output.

---

## 7. Phase 2: Specify — Math to YAML Contract

### Translation Rules

Each proof obligation becomes a contract entry:

| Math Concept | YAML Field |
|-------------|------------|
| Governing equation | `equations.<name>.formula` |
| Domain | `equations.<name>.domain` |
| Codomain | `equations.<name>.codomain` |
| Invariant | `proof_obligations[].type: invariant` |
| Equivalence | `proof_obligations[].type: equivalence` |
| Bound | `proof_obligations[].type: bound` |
| Tolerance | `proof_obligations[].tolerance` |
| Falsification | `falsification_tests[]` |

### Tolerance Selection

Tolerances are derived from the arithmetic, not guessed:

| Operation | Source of Error | Typical Tolerance |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| f32 addition (n terms) | Catastrophic cancellation | `n * f32::EPSILON` |
| f32 multiply-accumulate | Rounding per FMA | `sqrt(n) * f32::EPSILON` |
| Quantized dot product | Dequantization error | `ULP_TOLERANCE * f32::EPSILON` per contract |
| Softmax normalization | Exp + division | `1e-6` absolute on sum |
| RMSNorm | Sqrt + division | `1e-4` absolute |
| SIMD vs scalar | Reassociation | `ULP_TOLERANCE` (format-specific, see qdot contract) |

### The Critical Rule

> **Every YAML entry must be traceable to a specific equation in the paper.**
> If you cannot point to a formula, you cannot write a contract for it.
> If you cannot write a contract, you cannot write a falsification test.
> If you cannot write a falsification test, you are guessing.

---

## 8. Phase 3: Scaffold — Contract to Rust Trait + Failing Tests

### Trait Generation

The YAML contract generates a Rust trait. Each equation becomes a method.
Each proof obligation becomes a doc-comment with `INVARIANT:` or `REQUIRES:`
prefix.

```rust
/// Kernel contract: softmax-kernel-v1.yaml
/// Paper: Goodfellow et al. (2016), Deep Learning, Ch. 6.2.2
///
/// Governing equation:
///   softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i - max(x)) / sum_j(exp(x_j - max(x)))
pub trait SoftmaxKernel {
    /// Compute softmax over a single row.
    ///
    /// REQUIRES: input.len() >= 1
    /// REQUIRES: all values in input are finite
    ///
    /// INVARIANT (SM-INV-001): |sum(output) - 1.0| < 1e-6
    /// INVARIANT (SM-INV-002): output[i] > 0 for all i
    /// INVARIANT (SM-INV-003): 0 < output[i] < 1 for all i
    /// EQUIVALENCE (SM-EQV-001): softmax(x) == softmax(x + c) for all c
    /// MONOTONICITY (SM-MON-001): x[i] > x[j] implies output[i] > output[j]
    fn softmax(&self, input: &[f32], output: &mut [f32]);
}
```

### Test Generation

Each proof obligation generates a failing test:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod contract_tests {
    use super::*;

    /// FALSIFY-SM-001: Softmax rows sum to 1.0
    /// Prediction: |sum(softmax(x)) - 1.0| < 1e-6 for all finite x
    /// If fails: Missing max-subtraction trick or accumulation error
    #[test]
    fn falsify_sm_001_normalization() {
        todo!("Implementation not yet written — test MUST fail")
    }

    /// FALSIFY-SM-002: Shift invariance
    /// Prediction: softmax(x) == softmax(x + c) within tolerance
    /// If fails: Not using numerically stable variant
    #[test]
    fn falsify_sm_002_shift_invariance() {
        todo!("Implementation not yet written — test MUST fail")
    }

    /// FALSIFY-SM-003: SIMD matches scalar reference
    /// Prediction: |simd_result - scalar_result| < ULP_TOLERANCE * epsilon
    /// If fails: SIMD reassociation or wrong lane extraction
    #[test]
    fn falsify_sm_003_simd_parity() {
        todo!("Implementation not yet written — test MUST fail")
    }
}
```

### The Rule

> **All scaffold tests MUST fail.** If a test passes before implementation,
> either the test is wrong (vacuously true) or the implementation already
> exists (and the contract is redundant).

---

## 9. Phase 4: Implement — Scalar Reference then SIMD

### Order of Implementation

```
1. Scalar reference (ground truth)
   ↓
2. Tests pass for scalar
   ↓
3. SIMD variant (AVX2, AVX-512, NEON)
   ↓
4. SIMD tests pass AND SIMD matches scalar within ULP tolerance
   ↓
5. Dispatch table updated in contract YAML
```

### The Scalar Reference is Sacrosanct

The scalar implementation is the **mathematical reference**. It must be:
- As close to the paper's equation as possible
- Readable (no bit tricks, no manual unrolling)
- Correct to within f32 arithmetic limits

The SIMD implementation is an **optimization** of the scalar reference. It is
allowed to diverge only within the contract's ULP tolerance. If SIMD and scalar
disagree beyond tolerance, the SIMD implementation is wrong — not the scalar.

This mirrors the existing pattern in `quantized-dot-product-v1.yaml`:
```yaml
kernel_correctness:
  description: "Every SIMD kernel must produce output within ULP_TOLERANCE of scalar reference"
  check: "contract_tests::FALSIFY-QDOT-001 — proptest with random weights and activations"
  severity: "ERROR"
```

### SIMD Dispatch Table

Following the established pattern, every contract has an exhaustive dispatch
table. No `_ =>` catch-all allowed (lesson from `tensor-layout-v1.yaml`
PMAT-232).

```yaml
simd_dispatch:
  softmax:
    scalar: "softmax_scalar"
    avx2: "softmax_avx2"
    avx512: "softmax_avx512"
    neon: "softmax_neon"
```

### CUDA PTX Kernels

The implementation flow extends to include PTX as a third backend:

```
1. Scalar reference (ground truth)
   ↓
2. Tests pass for scalar
   ↓
3. AVX2 variant
   ↓
4. AVX2 parity tests pass (ULP tolerance)
   ↓
5. PTX kernel (inline assembly string)
   ↓
6. PTX structural tests pass
   ↓
7. Dispatch table updated in contract YAML
```

PTX kernels use hardware approximations (`ex2.approx`, `rsqrt.approx`, FMA) and
are **not** required to match scalar bit-for-bit. They must be loadable by
`cuModuleLoadData`, target `sm_90`, and use `.version 8.5`.

Each PTX kernel is returned as a `&'static str` from a Rust function. This allows
compile-time embedding without runtime file I/O. The PTX string is valid NVIDIA
PTX assembly that can be JIT-compiled by the CUDA driver API.

### Dispatch Table Extension

The `simd_dispatch` section in each contract YAML extends with a `ptx` entry:

```yaml
simd_dispatch:
  softmax:
    scalar: "softmax_scalar"
    avx2: "softmax_avx2"
    ptx: "softmax_ptx"
```

The PTX entry maps to a function returning `&'static str` containing the PTX
assembly source. This is distinct from scalar/AVX2 entries which map to
executable Rust functions.

### The `kernels` Module

All kernel implementations live in `crates/provable-contracts/src/kernels/`.
Each kernel submodule provides three functions following a consistent pattern:

- `fn {name}_scalar(...)` — Pure Rust scalar reference implementation
- `unsafe fn {name}_avx2(...)` — AVX2 SIMD implementation (unsafe due to intrinsics)
- `fn {name}_ptx() -> &'static str` — Returns PTX assembly source as a static string

The module is organized by kernel category:

| Category | Kernels |
|----------|---------|
| Elementwise | relu, gelu, silu, sigmoid |
| Normalization | softmax, rmsnorm, layernorm, batchnorm |
| Gated + Positional + Loss | swiglu, cross-entropy, rope |
| Matrix | matmul, attention, gqa, flash-attention |
| Optimizer + Sequence + ML | adamw, conv1d, ssm, kmeans, pagerank, lbfgs, cma-es, gated-delta-net |

---

## 10. Phase 5: Falsify — Property Testing via probar + certeza

### Property-Based Testing (probar)

Each proof obligation maps to a probar property test:

```rust
/// SM-INV-001: Normalization invariant
#[probar::property]
fn prop_softmax_sums_to_one(xs: Vec<f32>) -> bool {
    let result = softmax_scalar(&xs);
    (result.iter().sum::<f32>() - 1.0).abs() < 1e-6
}

/// SM-EQV-001: Shift invariance
#[probar::property]
fn prop_softmax_shift_invariant(xs: Vec<f32>, c: f32) -> bool {
    let shifted: Vec<f32> = xs.iter().map(|x| x + c).collect();
    let r1 = softmax_scalar(&xs);
    let r2 = softmax_scalar(&shifted);
    r1.iter().zip(r2.iter()).all(|(a, b)| (a - b).abs() < 1e-6)
}
```

### Metamorphic Relations (probar)

Metamorphic relations test properties that relate different inputs/outputs
without knowing the exact expected output:

```rust
/// SM-MON-001: Monotonicity — order is preserved
#[probar::metamorphic]
fn mr_softmax_preserves_order(xs: Vec<f32>) {
    let result = softmax_scalar(&xs);
    for i in 0..xs.len() {
        for j in 0..xs.len() {
            if xs[i] > xs[j] {
                assert!(result[i] > result[j],
                    "softmax must preserve order: x[{}]={} > x[{}]={} but σ[{}]={} <= σ[{}]={}",
                    i, xs[i], j, xs[j], i, result[i], j, result[j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### SIMD Parity (probar)

The universal SIMD parity test — every contract gets one:

```rust
/// FALSIFY-<PREFIX>-SIMD: SIMD matches scalar within ULP tolerance
#[probar::property]
fn prop_simd_matches_scalar(data: Vec<f32>) -> bool {
    let scalar_result = softmax_scalar(&data);
    let simd_result = softmax_avx2(&data);
    scalar_result.iter().zip(simd_result.iter()).all(|(s, a)| {
        let ulp_diff = (s.to_bits() as i32 - a.to_bits() as i32).unsigned_abs();
        ulp_diff <= ULP_TOLERANCE
    })
}
```

### Cross-Kernel Isolation

Adapted from `FALSIFY-QDOT-002` — verify that using the wrong kernel produces
garbage, not accidentally correct results:

```rust
/// FALSIFY-<PREFIX>-ISOLATION: Wrong kernel produces garbage
#[test]
fn falsify_cross_kernel_isolation() {
    let input = generate_test_vector(256);
    let correct = rmsnorm_scalar(&input, &weights, eps);
    let wrong = layernorm_scalar(&input, &weights, eps); // wrong kernel!
    let diff = l2_distance(&correct, &wrong);
    assert!(diff > 1.0, "RMSNorm and LayerNorm must differ — if not, kernels are not isolated");
}
```

### Quality Gates (certeza)

Every contract defines a QA gate that certeza enforces:

```yaml
qa_gate:
  id: "F-SOFTMAX-001"
  name: "Softmax Kernel Contract"
  checks:
    - "All normalization tests pass (SM-INV-001)"
    - "Shift invariance holds (SM-EQV-001)"
    - "SIMD matches scalar (FALSIFY-SM-003)"
    - "Monotonicity holds (SM-MON-001)"
  pass_criteria: "All falsification tests pass"
  falsification: "Introduce off-by-one in max reduction — gate must catch"
```

---

## 11. Phase 6: Verify — Bounded Proof via Kani

This is the phase that makes "provable" mean provable. Kani transforms
property-based tests (Level 3: "checked 10,000 random inputs") into bounded
proofs (Level 4: "verified for ALL inputs up to size N").

### 11.1 Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install Kani (one-time)
cargo install --locked kani-verifier
cargo kani setup

# Cargo.toml: suppress cfg(kani) warnings
[lints.rust]
unexpected_cfgs = { level = "warn", check-cfg = ['cfg(kani)'] }
```

Kani harnesses live behind `#[cfg(kani)]` — they don't affect normal builds,
tests, or benchmarks. They only activate under `cargo kani`.

### 11.2 Anatomy of a Kani Proof Harness

Every proof obligation from Phase 5 gets a corresponding Kani harness:

```rust
// File: src/softmax/kani_proofs.rs

#[cfg(kani)]
mod verification {
    use super::*;

    /// KANI-SM-001: Softmax normalization — PROVEN for all vectors ≤ 16 elements
    ///
    /// Obligation: SM-INV-001 (output sums to 1.0)
    /// Strategy: Stub exp() with bounded approximation, verify structural property
    /// Bound: 16 elements (covers common head dimensions / SIMD widths)
    #[kani::proof]
    #[kani::unwind(17)]  // loop bound + 1
    fn verify_softmax_normalization() {
        let n: usize = kani::any();
        kani::assume(n >= 1 && n <= 16);

        // Symbolic input: EVERY possible f32 vector of length n
        let input: Vec<f32> = (0..n).map(|_| kani::any()).collect();
        kani::assume(input.iter().all(|x| x.is_finite()));

        let mut output = vec![0.0f32; n];
        softmax_scalar(&input, &mut output);

        // Post-condition: output sums to 1.0 within tolerance
        let sum: f32 = output.iter().sum();
        assert!((sum - 1.0).abs() < 1e-5,
            "Softmax normalization violated: sum = {}", sum);

        // Post-condition: all outputs positive
        for i in 0..n {
            assert!(output[i] > 0.0, "Softmax output[{}] must be positive", i);
            assert!(output[i] < 1.0, "Softmax output[{}] must be < 1.0", i);
        }
    }
}
```

### 11.3 The Three Kani Verification Strategies

Different proof obligations require different strategies based on what
Kani can and cannot handle:

#### Strategy 1: Exhaustive (integer / structural logic)

For operations involving only integer arithmetic or structural properties,
Kani verifies exactly with zero false positives.

**Best for:** Quantized dot products, bsum precomputation, format dispatch,
shape validation, index bounds.

```rust
/// KANI-QDOT-001: Bsums precomputation — PROVEN EXACTLY
///
/// The offset term in quantized dot product depends only on activations.
/// Precomputed bsums must equal on-the-fly bsums for ALL possible inputs.
/// This is integer arithmetic — Kani verifies it exactly.
#[kani::proof]
#[kani::unwind(33)]  // 32 elements per sub-block + 1
fn verify_bsums_precomputation_exact() {
    // Symbolic activation block: every possible i8 value
    let activations: [i8; 32] = kani::any();

    // Precomputed bsum
    let precomputed: i32 = activations.iter().map(|&x| x as i32).sum();

    // On-the-fly bsum (as done inside the superblock loop)
    let mut online: i32 = 0;
    for i in 0..32 {
        online += activations[i] as i32;
    }

    // These MUST be exactly equal — integer arithmetic, no tolerance
    assert_eq!(precomputed, online,
        "Bsum precomputation diverges from online computation");
}
```

#### Strategy 2: Stub Float Transcendentals

For operations using `exp()`, `sqrt()`, `log()` — Kani over-approximates these
(returns any value in valid range). We stub them with bounded approximations
to avoid false positives while still verifying the structural logic.

**Best for:** Softmax, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, any kernel using transcendentals.

```rust
/// Bounded exp approximation for Kani verification.
/// Returns a value that satisfies exp()'s key properties:
///   - exp(x) > 0 for all x
///   - exp(0) = 1
///   - exp is monotonically increasing
/// This is NOT numerically accurate — it's a CONTRACT STUB that
/// preserves the properties we're verifying.
#[cfg(kani)]
fn exp_stub(x: f32) -> f32 {
    // Use a polynomial approximation valid for small ranges
    // For verification, we only need the structural properties
    let result: f32 = kani::any();
    kani::assume(result > 0.0);           // exp(x) > 0 always
    kani::assume(result.is_finite());
    result
}

#[kani::proof]
#[kani::stub(f32::exp, exp_stub)]
#[kani::unwind(17)]
fn verify_softmax_positivity_with_stub() {
    let n: usize = kani::any();
    kani::assume(n >= 1 && n <= 16);

    let input: Vec<f32> = (0..n).map(|_| kani::any()).collect();
    kani::assume(input.iter().all(|x| x.is_finite()));

    let mut output = vec![0.0f32; n];
    softmax_scalar(&input, &mut output);

    // Even with approximate exp, all outputs must be positive
    for i in 0..n {
        assert!(output[i] > 0.0);
    }
}
```

#### Strategy 3: Function Contracts (Compositional)

For composite kernels (attention = softmax + matmul + scale), verify each
sub-kernel independently, then compose using `#[kani::stub_verified]`.

**Best for:** Attention, transformer layers, any multi-step pipeline.

```rust
/// Contract for softmax: preconditions + postconditions
#[kani::requires(input.len() >= 1)]
#[kani::requires(input.iter().all(|x| x.is_finite()))]
#[kani::ensures(|result| result.iter().all(|&x| x > 0.0 && x < 1.0))]
#[kani::ensures(|result| (result.iter().sum::<f32>() - 1.0).abs() < 1e-5)]
pub fn softmax_verified(input: &[f32]) -> Vec<f32> {
    softmax_scalar(input)
}

/// Verify softmax contract itself
#[kani::proof_for_contract(softmax_verified)]
#[kani::unwind(17)]
fn verify_softmax_contract() {
    let n: usize = kani::any();
    kani::assume(n >= 1 && n <= 16);
    let input: Vec<f32> = (0..n).map(|_| kani::any()).collect();
    softmax_verified(&input);
}

/// Now use verified softmax contract in attention proof —
/// softmax is replaced with its contract abstraction (free postconditions)
#[kani::proof]
#[kani::stub_verified(softmax_verified)]
#[kani::unwind(9)]
fn verify_attention_uses_normalized_weights() {
    let seq_len: usize = kani::any();
    kani::assume(seq_len >= 1 && seq_len <= 8);

    let scores: Vec<f32> = (0..seq_len).map(|_| kani::any()).collect();
    kani::assume(scores.iter().all(|x| x.is_finite()));

    // softmax_verified is replaced with: assume(preconditions) → any_where(postconditions)
    let weights = softmax_verified(&scores);

    // This is now guaranteed by the verified contract — not tested, PROVEN:
    assert!(weights.iter().all(|&w| w > 0.0));
    assert!((weights.iter().sum::<f32>() - 1.0).abs() < 1e-5);
}
```

### 11.4 SIMD Parity Proofs

The highest-value Kani harness: prove SIMD kernels match scalar for ALL inputs.

Kani supports all SIMD intrinsics (`simd_add`, `simd_mul`, `simd_shuffle`,
`simd_reduce_*`, etc.), making this a natural fit.

```rust
/// KANI-QDOT-SIMD-001: AVX2 Q4K dot product matches scalar — PROVEN
///
/// For ALL possible 256-element super-blocks and ALL possible activation
/// vectors, the AVX2 kernel produces the same result as the scalar kernel.
/// Integer sub-block arithmetic — exact verification, no tolerance.
#[kani::proof]
#[kani::unwind(257)]  // 256 elements + 1
#[kani::solver(kissat)]
fn verify_q4k_simd_matches_scalar() {
    // Symbolic Q4_K super-block (144 bytes)
    let block: [u8; 144] = kani::any();
    // Symbolic activation vector (256 i8 values for Q8_K path)
    let activations: [i8; 256] = kani::any();

    let scalar_result = fused_q4k_dot_scalar(&block, &activations);
    let simd_result = fused_q4k_dot_avx2(&block, &activations);

    // Within ULP tolerance from contract (8 ULPs for Q4_K)
    let ulp_diff = (scalar_result.to_bits() as i32 - simd_result.to_bits() as i32).unsigned_abs();
    assert!(ulp_diff <= 8, "SIMD diverges from scalar by {} ULPs", ulp_diff);
}
```

### 11.5 Negative Verification (should_panic)

Prove that invalid inputs MUST be rejected:

```rust
/// KANI-LAYOUT-001: ValidatedEmbedding rejects >50% zeros — PROVEN
///
/// For ALL possible data vectors with >50% zeros, the constructor panics.
/// This is the Poka-Yoke guarantee — mistakes are physically impossible.
#[kani::proof]
#[kani::should_panic]
#[kani::unwind(17)]
fn verify_validated_embedding_rejects_zeros() {
    let n: usize = kani::any();
    kani::assume(n >= 2 && n <= 16);

    let data: Vec<f32> = (0..n).map(|_| kani::any()).collect();
    let zero_count = data.iter().filter(|&&x| x == 0.0).count();

    // Assume MORE than 50% zeros
    kani::assume(zero_count * 2 > n);

    // This MUST panic — if it doesn't, Kani reports FAILURE
    ValidatedEmbedding::new(data, n, 1).unwrap();
}
```

### 11.6 Concrete Playback

When Kani finds a counterexample, it generates a concrete unit test:

```bash
# Run Kani with concrete playback
cargo kani --harness verify_softmax_normalization --concrete-playback=inplace
```

This adds a `#[test]` to your source code with the exact input that triggered
the failure — bridging Level 4 back to Level 2 for debugging:

```rust
// Automatically generated by Kani
#[test]
fn kani_concrete_playback_verify_softmax_normalization() {
    let input = vec![3.4028235e38_f32, -3.4028235e38, 0.0, 1.0];
    let mut output = vec![0.0; 4];
    softmax_scalar(&input, &mut output);
    let sum: f32 = output.iter().sum();
    assert!((sum - 1.0).abs() < 1e-5); // FAILS — exposes edge case
}
```

### 11.7 Kani in CI

```yaml
# .github/workflows/kani.yml
name: Kani Verification
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: model-checking/kani-github-action@v1
        with:
          args: --all-harnesses
```

### 11.8 Contract YAML: Kani Harness Registry

Every contract lists its Kani harnesses alongside falsification tests:

```yaml
kani_harnesses:
  - id: KANI-SM-001
    obligation: SM-INV-001
    property: "Softmax output sums to 1.0"
    bound: 16
    strategy: stub_float
    solver: cadical
    harness: verify_softmax_normalization

  - id: KANI-SM-002
    obligation: SM-INV-002
    property: "Softmax outputs are positive"
    bound: 16
    strategy: stub_float
    harness: verify_softmax_positivity

  - id: KANI-SM-003
    obligation: SM-EQV-001
    property: "SIMD matches scalar"
    bound: 256
    strategy: exhaustive
    solver: kissat
    harness: verify_softmax_simd_parity

  - id: KANI-SM-004
    obligation: SM-MON-001
    property: "Softmax preserves input order"
    bound: 8
    strategy: stub_float
    harness: verify_softmax_monotonicity
```

### 11.9 What Kani Cannot Verify (and What Fills the Gap)

| Property | Kani | Alternative | Why |
|----------|------|-------------|-----|
| Numerical accuracy of `exp()` | Over-approx | probar proptest (L3) | Kani returns any positive float for exp |
| Numerical accuracy of `sqrt()` | Over-approximated | probar proptest (Level 3) | Same issue |
| Unbounded vector lengths | Bounded to N | probar proptest (Level 3) | Kani requires finite unwind |
| Concurrent dispatch | Not supported | Manual review + integration tests | Kani is single-threaded |
| GPU kernel correctness | Not supported | Layer parity tool (`apr parity`) | Kani verifies CPU only |
| End-to-end inference | Too large | Golden trace validation | State space too large |

**The principle:** Kani proves structural and algebraic properties exhaustively.
probar tests numerical accuracy statistically. Together they cover all
obligations at appropriate levels.

### 11.10 Kani Verification Targets by Kernel

| Kernel | Exhaustive (exact) | Stub-float | Compositional |
|--------|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| Quantized dot product | bsums, scale extraction, nibble packing | Final f32 accumulation | N/A (leaf kernel) |
| Softmax | Output bounds, index safety | Normalization sum, monotonicity | Used by attention |
| RMSNorm | Sum-of-squares non-negative | Normalization to unit RMS | Used by transformer layer |
| RoPE | Rotation structure, periodicity | sin/cos accuracy | Used by attention |
| SwiGLU | Gate × up structure | Swish activation | Used by FFN |
| MatMul | Index bounds, shape | Accumulation | Used by everything |
| Attention | Score scaling, shape | Softmax + matmul composition | Via `stub_verified` |

---

## 12. Proof Obligation Taxonomy

Every mathematical property from a paper falls into one of these categories:

### 12.1 Invariant

**Definition:** A property that holds for ALL valid inputs.

**Pattern:** `∀x ∈ Domain: P(f(x))` is true.

**Examples:**
- Softmax: `sum(output) = 1.0`
- RMSNorm: `rms(output) ≈ 1.0` (before scaling)
- Attention weights: `sum(weights_per_query) = 1.0`

**Test strategy:** probar property test with random inputs.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` with `kani::any()` inputs up to natural bound.

### 12.2 Equivalence

**Definition:** Two computations produce the same result.

**Pattern:** `∀x: f(x) = g(x)` within tolerance.

**Examples:**
- Softmax: `softmax(x) = softmax(x - max(x))`
- SIMD vs scalar: `f_avx2(x) ≈ f_scalar(x)`
- GPU vs CPU: `f_gpu(x) ≈ f_cpu(x)`

**Test strategy:** probar property test comparing two implementations.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` comparing both implementations on
`kani::any()`. For SIMD vs scalar, this is the highest-value Kani harness —
SIMD intrinsics are fully supported.

### 12.3 Bound

**Definition:** Output is bounded within a range.

**Pattern:** `∀x: a ≤ f(x)_i ≤ b`

**Examples:**
- Softmax: `0 < output_i < 1`
- Sigmoid: `0 < output < 1`
- Tanh: `-1 < output < 1`
- ReLU: `output ≥ 0`

**Test strategy:** probar property test checking range.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` asserting bounds on all outputs. Kani
excels at this — range checks are simple assertions.

### 12.4 Monotonicity

**Definition:** Order is preserved (or reversed) through the function.

**Pattern:** `x_i > x_j → f(x)_i > f(x)_j` (or `<` for reversed).

**Examples:**
- Softmax: order-preserving
- Negation: order-reversing

**Test strategy:** probar property test with ordered pairs.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` with two symbolic values where
`kani::assume(a > b)`, assert `f(a) > f(b)`. Requires stub_float for
transcendentals.

### 12.5 Idempotency

**Definition:** Applying the function twice yields the same result as once.

**Pattern:** `f(f(x)) = f(x)`

**Examples:**
- ReLU: `relu(relu(x)) = relu(x)`
- Softmax: NOT idempotent (applying twice changes output)
- Normalization: NOT idempotent in general

**Test strategy:** probar property test composing function with itself.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` applying function twice, asserting
`f(f(x)) == f(x)`. Exact for integer operations (ReLU).

### 12.6 Linearity / Homogeneity

**Definition:** Scaling input scales output proportionally.

**Pattern:** `f(αx) = α·f(x)` (homogeneous of degree 1).

**Examples:**
- Matrix multiply in V: `Attn(Q,K,αV) = α·Attn(Q,K,V)`
- ReLU: `relu(αx) = α·relu(x)` for α > 0
- Softmax: NOT homogeneous

**Test strategy:** probar metamorphic test with random scaling factor.
**Proof strategy:** `#[kani::proof]` with symbolic `alpha: f32`, verify
`f(alpha * x) == alpha * f(x)`. Requires stub_float if function uses
transcendentals.

### 12.7 Symmetry / Antisymmetry

**Definition:** Function behavior under input permutation.

**Examples:**
- Dot product: `dot(a,b) = dot(b,a)` (symmetric)
- Softmax: NOT permutation-invariant on output (but set-invariant on output set)

### 12.8 Associativity

**Definition:** Grouping doesn't matter.

**Pattern:** `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)`

**Critical for SIMD:** Floating-point addition is NOT associative. SIMD
reassociation changes results. This is why we need ULP tolerances.

**Examples:**
- FP addition: NOT associative (SIMD source of error)
- Integer addition: associative (SIMD is exact)

### 12.9 Conservation

**Definition:** A quantity is preserved through computation.

**Pattern:** `Q(state_before) = Q(state_after)`

**Examples:**
- EDD harmonic oscillator: `E = KE + PE` is constant
- Attention: total probability mass = 1.0 per query
- Residual connections: information is preserved (additive)

## 13. Kernel Contract Registry

### Naming Convention

```
<operation>-kernel-v<version>.yaml
```

Examples:
- `softmax-kernel-v1.yaml`
- `rmsnorm-kernel-v1.yaml`
- `attention-kernel-v1.yaml`
- `rope-kernel-v1.yaml`
- `matmul-kernel-v1.yaml`

### Contract ID Convention

Falsification test IDs follow: `FALSIFY-<PREFIX>-NNN`

| Contract | Prefix |
|----------|--------|
| Softmax | SM |
| RMSNorm | RMS |
| Attention | ATTN |
| FlashAttention | FATTN |
| RoPE | ROPE |
| MatMul (GEMM/GEMV) | MM |
| SwiGLU/GeGLU | ACT |
| Quantized Dot Product | QDOT |
| Tensor Layout | LAYOUT |
| Layer Parity | PARITY |
| Kernel Fusion | FUSION |

### QA Gate ID Convention

`F-<PREFIX>-NNN` (matches certeza format).

---

## 14. Existing Contracts (aprender)

These four contracts already exist in `aprender/contracts/` and serve as the
reference implementation of this specification:

### 14.1 quantized-dot-product-v1.yaml

**Papers:** GPTQ (Frantar 2022, arXiv:2210.17323), LLM.int8() (Dettmers 2022),
GGML K-quant (ggerganov), Wulf & McKee 1995 (Memory Wall).

**Key equation:**
```
dot(W, x) = Σ_superblock [
  SCALE:  d_W * d_x * Σ_j(s_j * Σ_i(q_W_i * q_x_i))
  OFFSET: dmin_W * d_x * Σ_j(m_j * Σ_i(q_x_i))        ← bsums
]
```

**Key insight:** The offset term depends ONLY on activations (not weights),
so bsums can be precomputed once and reused across all weight rows.

**Falsification tests:** 5 (FALSIFY-QDOT-001 through 005).
**Format registry:** Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q4_0, Q8_0 with full byte layouts.
**SIMD dispatch:** Exhaustive per format × ISA (scalar, AVX2, AVX-512 VNNI).

### 14.2 tensor-layout-v1.yaml

**Theoretical basis:** Poka-Yoke (Shingo 1986), Popperian Falsificationism
(Popper 1959), Type-Driven Development (Brady 2017), Parse Don't Validate
(King 2019).

**Key principle:** `ValidatedTensor` newtypes make it IMPOSSIBLE (at compile
time) to use unvalidated data. Private inner fields + validated constructors.

**Falsification tests:** 8 (FALSIFY-001 through 008).
**Root cause:** PMAT-234 (SafeTensors 94.5% zeros passed structural checks).

### 14.3 layer-parity-v1.yaml

**Problem:** 4 independent forward pass implementations (CPU SIMD, GPU
workspace, GPU graphed, GPU async) with no structural guarantee of equivalence.

**Key specification:** 14-step transformer layer forward pass with per-step
tolerance bounds.

**Enforcement:** `apr parity model.gguf` tool with cosine similarity ≥ 0.999,
KL divergence < 0.01, sigma ≥ 3.0, Cpk ≥ 1.33.

**Falsification tests:** 4 (PARITY-001 through 004).
**Root cause:** PMAT-232 (7B GPU garbage output).

### 14.4 kernel-fusion-v1.yaml

**Theoretical basis:** Toyota Production System / Poka-Yoke (Shingo 1986),
Roofline Model (Williams et al. 2009), CUDA Graph Replay.

**Key principle:** Every fusion decision is documented with status (ACTIVE,
BLOCKED, PLANNED, REJECTED) and measurable benchmarks. No undocumented fusion.

**Root cause:** PAR-077 (fused kernel existed but was never wired in; when
tried, it was 3x slower due to shared memory overhead).

### Batuta Integration

Batuta orchestrates the pipeline, delegating to provable-contracts for
Phases 2-6:

```bash
# Phase 1: Extract equations from paper context
batuta oracle "softmax numerical stability" --arxiv --arxiv-live

# Phase 2: Validate contract (delegates to pv validate)
pv validate contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml

# Phase 3: Generate scaffold (delegates to pv scaffold)
pv scaffold contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml --output src/softmax/

# Phase 5: Run falsification suite (Level 3)
batuta falsify --contract contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml

# Phase 6: Run Kani proof harnesses (Level 4)
pv verify contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml
# or directly:
cargo kani --harness verify_softmax_normalization
cargo kani --harness verify_softmax_simd_parity --solver kissat

# Full status: which obligations are proven?
pv status contracts/
```

### Library Integration (Rust API)

Consumer crates (trueno, aprender, realizar) add provable-contracts as a
dev-dependency for contract-driven testing:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
provable-contracts = "0.1"
```

```rust
use provable_contracts::schema::parse_contract;
use provable_contracts::audit::audit_contract;

#[test]
fn test_contract_compliance() {
    let contract = parse_contract(
        Path::new("contracts/softmax-kernel-v1.yaml")
    ).unwrap();
    let report = audit_contract(&contract, Path::new("src/"));
    assert!(report.all_obligations_covered(),
        "Uncovered obligations: {:?}", report.gaps());
}
```

### EDD Recipe Integration

The `quality-edd` recipe from batuta's cookbook maps directly:

```
EDD Cycle              Provable Contracts Phase
─────────              ──────────────────
Equation        →      Phase 1 (Extract)

## 17. Contract Lifecycle

### Versioning

Contracts follow semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR:** Breaking change to equations, tolerance tightening, new required
  proof obligations. Consumers MUST update.
- **MINOR:** New optional proof obligations, new SIMD dispatch entries,
  additional falsification tests. Consumers SHOULD update.
- **PATCH:** Typo fixes, clarifications, additional references. No code changes
  needed.

### Evolution

```
v1.0.0  Initial contract from paper
  ↓
v1.1.0  Add SIMD dispatch for new ISA (e.g., AVX-512 VNNI)
  ↓
v1.2.0  Add falsification test from production incident
  ↓
v2.0.0  New paper with better algorithm (e.g., FlashAttention replaces naive attention)
```

### The Kaizen Principle

> When a production incident reveals a failure mode not covered by the
> contract, the contract MUST be updated before the code is fixed.

This is the tensor-layout-v1.yaml lesson: PMAT-234 revealed that semantic
validation (data quality) was missing. The contract was updated to v2.0.0
with semantic validation rules BEFORE the code was patched.

## 18. Examples

### 18.1 Complete Example: RMSNorm

**Phase 1 — Extract from Zhang & Sennrich 2019 (arXiv:1910.10683):**

```
RMSNorm(x) = (x / RMS(x)) * γ
where RMS(x) = √(1/n · Σ x_i² + ε)
```

Proof obligations:
- RMS-INV-001: Output has unit RMS (before γ scaling)
- RMS-INV-002: γ=1 gives unit RMS output
- RMS-LIN-001: `RMSNorm(αx, γ) = sign(α) · RMSNorm(x, γ)` (homogeneous degree 0 in x, then γ-scaled)
- RMS-EQV-001: SIMD matches scalar

**Phase 2 — Contract YAML (abbreviated):**

**Phase 3 — Rust trait:**

```rust
/// Contract: rmsnorm-kernel-v1.yaml
/// Paper: Zhang & Sennrich (2019) arXiv:1910.10683
pub trait RmsNormKernel {
    /// INVARIANT (RMS-INV-001): RMS(output / γ) ≈ 1.0
    /// EQUIVALENCE (RMS-EQV-001): SIMD matches scalar ± 8 ULPs
    fn rmsnorm(&self, input: &[f32], gamma: &[f32], eps: f32, output: &mut [f32]);
}
```

**Phase 4 — Scalar reference:**

```rust
pub fn rmsnorm_scalar(input: &[f32], gamma: &[f32], eps: f32, output: &mut [f32]) {
    let n = input.len() as f32;
    let sum_sq: f32 = input.iter().map(|x| x * x).sum();
    let rms = (sum_sq / n + eps).sqrt();
    let inv_rms = 1.0 / rms;
    for i in 0..input.len() {
        output[i] = input[i] * inv_rms * gamma[i];
    }
}
```

**Phase 5 — probar tests:**

```rust

    let gamma = vec![1.0; xs.len()]; // γ=1 to test normalization only

    rmsnorm_scalar(&xs, &gamma, eps, &mut output);
    let rms_out = (output.iter().map(|x| x * x).sum::<f32>() / output.len() as f32).sqrt();
    (rms_out - 1.0).abs() < 1e-4
}

#[probar::property]
fn prop_rmsnorm_simd_parity(xs: Vec<f32>, gamma: Vec<f32>) -> bool {
    let mut scalar_out = vec![0.0; xs.len()];
    let mut simd_out = vec![0.0; xs.len()];
    rmsnorm_scalar(&xs, &gamma, 1e-5, &mut scalar_out);
    rmsnorm_avx2(&xs, &gamma, 1e-5, &mut simd_out);
    scalar_out.iter().zip(simd_out.iter()).all(|(s, a)| {
        (s.to_bits() as i32 - a.to_bits() as i32).unsigned_abs() <= 8
